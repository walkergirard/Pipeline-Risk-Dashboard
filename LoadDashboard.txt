Here are instructions on how to view the dashboard.
Throughout the process of creating it, it has been loaded in locally through command prompt.
First download all the files off GitHub (GeoJSON folder from Google Drive (Listed below the steps) and put them all in one folder.

Steps:
1. First, open cmd. Then enter the first line of code below, replacing the file address to your own address where the dashboard folder is stored.
2. Then, apply the second line, which initiates a locally hosted server on your own computer.
3. Then paste the third line into a web browser (I used Google Chrome, but it should work for any browser), and the dashboard will display

Something else to note, the GeoJSON folder containing all relevant GeoJSON files was too big to upload to GitHub, or at least, I got an error when attempting to do so.
So, I have uploaded the folder to Google Drive for you to download here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sSlM0KC6Lg0ejHHSXZrXFEGgxumwgbcd?usp=drive_link

cd "C:\Users\walke\OneDrive\Desktop\CorrosionRiskModelData\Final_Dashboard"

python -m http.server 8000
